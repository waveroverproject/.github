# Wave Rover Project
This project simulates and then implements on real hardware a differential drive small UGV robot with a Realsense D435 depth camera with a custom 3D printed camera holding bracket. 
It implements a web app mission planner and control GUI so the rover can be controlled remotely from a control station laptop or mobile with access to the same IP network.
